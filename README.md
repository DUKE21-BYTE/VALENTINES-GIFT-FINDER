## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The aesthetic is built around a **Premium Romantic** theme:

- **Palette**: Deep wines (`#6B1839`), soft roses (`#C2185B`), and warm golds (`#D4A574`).
- **Typography**: _Cormorant Garamond_ for headers evokes elegance and tradition, while _Outfit_ provides a clean, modern readability for body text.
- **Interaction**: Micro-interactions (hover states, floating hearts, toast notifications) make the experience feel "alive" and celebratory.
